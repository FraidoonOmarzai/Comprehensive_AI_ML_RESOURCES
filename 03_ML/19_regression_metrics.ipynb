    "- Calculate the absolute difference between actual and predicted values\n",

    "\n",
    "- Same unit\n",
    "- Robust to outlier\n",
    "\n",
    "**Disadvantages:**\n",
    "\n",
    "- Fails to punish the bigger error terms\n",
    "- The graph is not differentiable, so we have to apply various optimizers like gradient decent\n",

    "\n",
    "- Finding the squared difference between actual and predicted values\n",

    "\n",
    "- Graph is differentiable\n",
    "\n",
    "**Disadvantages:**\n",

    "- Not robust to outlier because it penalizes the outlier too much\n",

    "- R-squared shows how well the data fit the regression model (the goodness of fit)\n",
    "- 0 =< R2 =< 1\n",
    "- The drawback is when we add new features to data the R2 score starts increasing or remains constant but it never decreases, because it assumes that while adding more data variance of data increase\n",
