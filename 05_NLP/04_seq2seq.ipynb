    "<h1 align=center> Seq2Seq (Encoder/Decoder) And Attention Mechanism In Depth</h1>\n",
    "\n",
    "- Sequence-to-sequence (seq2seq) models are a type of neural network architecture used primarily for tasks where the input and output are sequences of data, which can vary in length. They have been widely used in various applications, including machine translation, text summarization, and speech recognition.\n",

    "### Key Components\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Encoder**: The encoder processes the input sequence and compresses it into a fixed-size context vector (also called a thought vector). It typically consists of Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs), Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks, or Gated Recurrent Units (GRUs).\n",
    "2. **Decoder**: The decoder takes the context vector produced by the encoder and generates the output sequence. Like the encoder, it is usually an RNN, LSTM, or GRU.\n",
    "3. **Attention Mechanism**: An enhancement to the basic seq2seq model, the attention mechanism allows the model to focus on different parts of the input sequence at each step of the output generation. This helps in handling longer sequences more effectively.\n",

    "\n",
    "1. **Input Sequence**: A sequence of tokens (e.g., words in a sentence) is fed into the encoder.\n",
    "2. **Encoder**: The encoder processes this sequence and outputs a context vector.\n",
    "3. **Context Vector**: This vector captures the information from the entire input sequence.\n",
    "4. **Decoder**: The context vector is fed into the decoder, which generates the output sequence token by token.\n",
    "5. **Output Sequence**: The generated sequence is the model's final output.\n",

    "- Our model reads an input sentence “ABC” and produces “WXYZ” as the output sentence.\n",
    "- The model stops making predictions after outputting the end-of-sentence token.\n",
    "- Note that the LSTM reads the input sentence in reverse, because doing so introduces many short term dependencies in the data that make the optimization problem much easier.\n",

    "**Model:**\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "h_{<t>} = sigm(W_{hx}X + W_{hh} h_{<t-1>}) \\\\y_{<t>} = W_{yh}h_{<t>}\n",

    "- The goal of the LSTM is to estimate the conditional probability p(y1, . . . , yT′ |x1, . . . , xT ) where\n",
    "(x1, . . . , xT ) is an input sequence and y1, . . . , yT′ is its corresponding output sequence whose length T′ may differ from T.\n",
    "- The LSTM computes this conditional probability by first obtaining the fixed dimensional representation v of the input sequence (x1, . . . , xT ) given by the last hidden state of the\n",
    "LSTM, and then computing the probability of y1, . . . , yT′ with a standard LSTM-LM formulation\n",
    "whose initial hidden state is set to the representation v of x1, . . . , xT :\n",

    "- In this equation, each p(yt|v, y1, . . . , yt−1) distribution is represented with a softmax over all the\n",
    "words in the vocabulary. We use the LSTM formulation from Graves.\n",
    "- Note that we require that each sentence ends with a special end-of-sentence symbol “<EOS>”, which enables the model to define a distribution over sequences of all possible lengths. The overall scheme is outlined in above picture, where the shown LSTM computes the representation of “A”, “B”, “C”, “<EOS>” and then uses this representation to compute the probability of “W”, “X”, “Y”, “Z”, “<EOS>”.\n",

    "**Research Paper Key Points About The Model:**\n",
    "\n",
    "- Our actual models differ from the above description in three important ways. First, we used two\n",
    "different LSTMs: one for the input sequence and another for the output sequence, because doing so increases the number model parameters at negligible computational cost and makes it natural to train the LSTM on multiple language pairs simultaneously.\n",
    "- Second, we found that deep LSTMs significantly outperformed shallow LSTMs, so we chose an LSTM with four layers.\n",
    "- Third, we found it extremely valuable to reverse the order of the words of the input sentence. So for example, instead of mapping the sentence a, b, c to the sentence α, β, γ, the LSTM is asked to map c, b, a to α, β, γ, where α, β, γ is the translation of a, b, c. This way, a is in close proximity to α, b is fairly close to β, and so on, a fact that makes it easy for SGD to “establish communication” between the input and the output. We found this simple data transformation to greatly boost the performance of the LSTM.\n",
