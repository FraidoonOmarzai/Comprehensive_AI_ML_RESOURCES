    "- A type of RNN designed to address the vanishing gradient problem, which is hard for simple RNN\n",
    "- LSTM is a special kind of RNN capable of learning long-term dependencies\n",
    "- The key to LSTMs is the cell state, which can carry information across many time steps, and three types of gates that regulate the flow of information into and out of the cell\n",

    "1. **Cell State (C<t>)**: The memory of the network.\n",

    "4. **Output Gate (o<t>)**: Decides what information to output based on the cell state.\n",

    "### **Key Differences Between LSTM and GRU:**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Gates**:\n",
    "    - LSTM has three gates (forget, input, output).\n",
    "    - GRU has two gates (update and reset).\n",
    "2. **Complexity**:\n",
    "    - LSTM is more complex due to having more gates and separate cell states.\n",
    "    - GRU is simpler and thus faster to train and easier to implement.\n",
    "3. **Performance**:\n",
    "    - Both can perform similarly on various tasks, but specific tasks might favor one architecture over the other.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Implementation Tips:**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Choosing between LSTM and GRU**:\n",
    "    - If you need a simpler and faster model, start with GRU\n",
    "    - For tasks requiring longer-term memory and more control over memory, use LSTM\n",
    "2. **Hyperparameters**:\n",
    "    - Number of layers and units per layer\n",
    "    - Learning rate, batch size, dropout rates, etc\n",
    "3. **Regularization**:\n",
    "    - Use techniques like dropout to prevent overfitting\n",
    "4. **Frameworks**:\n",
    "    - Popular deep learning frameworks like TensorFlow and PyTorch provide built-in support for LSTM and GRU layers"
