    "- Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), also called ConvNets, are a type of artificial neural network that excel at processing data with a grid-like structure, most commonly images\n",
    "- Convolutional Neural Networks have revolutionized the field of computer vision and beyond, providing state-of-the-art solutions to many complex problems\n",
    "- They are designed to automatically and adaptively learn spatial hierarchies of features through backpropagation by using multiple building blocks, such as convolution layers, pooling layers, and fully connected layers\n",

    "### **Key Components of CNNs**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Convolutional Layer**: This is the core building block of a CNN. It consists of a set of filters (or kernels) that are applied to the input image to produce feature maps. Each filter detects different features such as edges, textures, or patterns.\n",
    "    - **Filters/Kernels**: Are used to extract the essential features from the input data\n",
    "    - **Stride**: The step size by which the filter moves across the input\n",
    "    - **Padding**: It refers to the amount of pixel added, typically zeros, around the borders of the input feature map. Most common types of padding:\n",
    "        - Valid: no zeros are added\n",
    "        - Same: adds enough zeros to maintain the same height and width of the input feature map after convolution\n",
    "        - Below is the formula to find the size of height or weight of a layer for having valid or same padding:\n",
    "    \n",
    "    $$\n",
    "    valid = [\\frac{n-f}{s}+1] \\times [\\frac{n-f}{s}+1] \\times n_c\\\\ same = [\\frac{n+2p-f}{s}+1] \\times [\\frac{n+2p-f}{s}+1]\\times n_c \\\\ \\text{To find out the size of (h/w), we use the below formula}:\\\\ n_{h/w}^{[l]} = [\\frac{n_{h/w}^{[l-1]}+2p^{[l]}-f^{[l]}}{s^{[l]}}+1] \\times [\\frac{n_{h/w}^{[l-1]}+2p^{[l]}-f^{[l]}}{s^{[l]}}+1]\\times n_c\\\\ where:\\\\n_{h/w}^{[l]}: \\text{hight/width size of layer l}\\\\n_{h/w}^{[l-1]}: \\text{hight/width size of one layer before layer l}\\\\f^{[l]}:\\text{ fillter size layer l}\\\\p^{[l]}:\\text{ padding layer l}\\\\ \\\\s^{[l]}:\\text{ stride layer l}\\\\ n_c: \\text{number of channels}\n",
    "    $$\n",
    "    \n",
    "\n",
    "`Note:`If the input feature map has 3 channels (e.g., an RGB image), and the convolutional layer uses 32 filters, then the output feature map will have 32 channels.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Below is shown how CNN perform conv operation with having stride and padding equal to one\n",
    "\n",
    "![alt text](../Images/dl/cnn3.gif)\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Activation Function**: Typically, a nonlinear activation function like ReLU (Rectified Linear Unit) is applied to introduce non-linearity into the model\n",
    "3. **Pooling Layer**: Also known as subsampling or down-sampling, this layer reduces the spatial dimensions of the feature maps. Max pooling and average pooling are common types.\n",
    "    - **Max Pooling**: Takes the maximum value from each window of the feature map\n",
    "    - **Average Pooling**: Takes the average value from each window of the feature map\n",
    "\n",
    "![alt text](../Images/dl/cnn4.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Fully Connected (Dense) Layer**: These layers are similar to those in traditional neural networks and are used for the final classification. The output from the convolutional and pooling layers is flattened and fed into the fully connected layer. \n",
    "    - Flatten is used to convert pooled feature maps to a single column that is passed to the fully connected layer\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Training a CNN**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Forward Propagation**: Input data is passed through the network to obtain an output.\n",
    "2. **Loss Calculation**: A loss function (e.g., cross-entropy loss) measures the difference between the predicted output and the actual labels.\n",
    "3. **Backpropagation**: The gradients of the loss with respect to each parameter are computed, and the weights are updated using optimization algorithms like stochastic gradient descent (SGD) or Adam.\n",
